# HW 2 

Following the tutorials provided Google Cloud AI Platform (https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/tutorials?authuser=2), learned to use each platform below:

**Part 1: Hello AI Platform (Unified)**
- **Hello image data**, use an image dataset to train an AutoML model
  * Creative input: Test on a subset of Diabetic Retinopathy dataset (453 images)
- **Hello text data**, use a text dataset to train an AutoML model
  * Creative input: Test on Fake and Real News dataset (38,639 texts)
- **Hello video data**, use a video dataset to train an AutoML model
- **Hello custom training**, learn how to bring your own code to AI Platform, by using a sample app to train an image recognition model
- **Hello structured data**, use a structured dataset to train an AutoML model
  * Creative input: Test on Taiwan Bankruptcy dataset (6819 instances)
