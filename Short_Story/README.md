# Medium Short Story

The use of deep learning in the study of proteins is no stranger to those in the field of proteomics. However, to those that don’t have a background in biochemistry, it can be an overwhelming topic to grasp exactly the role machine learning plays in the drug discovery pipeline. The paper “Deep Learning in Proteomics” published from the scientific journal Proteomics in 2020 introduced their reader, the proteomics community, a comprehensive overview of what deep learning is and how it’s applied in the analysis of protein data. Similarly, my medium article aims to introduce those in the field of data science to understand how we can utilize our knowledge in the field of proteomics. I will discuss three deep learning applications in bioinformatics and provide some basic background on what they are. These topics are:
* Retention Time Prediction
* MS/MS (Mass Spectrometry) Spectrum Prediction
* De Novo Peptide Sequencing
